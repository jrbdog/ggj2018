    Subject: RE: Update on Project Ivins<br>
    <br>
    Dear Scott,<br>
    <br>
    The project is coming along nicely. The solution works on lab rats, but doesn't work on the chimpanzees. We estimate the project will take a few more months. We should still be on time.<br>
    <br>
    The disease is contained. No changes have been noted. As always, testing will continue. In fact, we are about to start child testing. We have 4 males and 4 females lined up. Donâ€™t worry, one is Dr. Roberts' child. He is scheduled to receive the first vial of the test antidote.<br>
    <br>
    As for our other project, we have had some delays. The flu vaccine won't be available in time for the holidays.<br>
    <br>
    See you soon,<br>
    Dr. Jerry Sang<br>
    Chief Biochemist<br>
